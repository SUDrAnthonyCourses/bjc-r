<p><br>Let's say you have a list of numbers, such as all the students' grades on a quiz. You want to find the average grade. There are two steps: First, add up all the numbers; then divide that sum by the number of numbers &#45 that is, by the length of the list.<br>
<!-- <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/average.png" alt="average uses COMBINE WITH +" title="average uses COMBINE WITH +"/> -->
<br>
Notice that there is a red <code>length</code> <code>of</code> block that finds the number of items in a list that is different from the green <code>length of</code> block that finds the number of letters in a text string.

<!-- <br><br>
The first input to the <code>combine with</code> block is a <i>two-input </i>function. In this case, it's the <b><code>+</code></b> block, because we want to add all the numbers. In fact, unlike the situation with the <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> blocks, there are really only a handful of functions you'll ever use with <b>combine</b>:<br>

</p>
Why did we include the addition and multiplication operators, but not subtraction or division? Using an operator with <code>combine</code> makes sense only if it doesn't matter whether the values are combined left to right or right to left. That is,
<br>
3+(4+5) = (3+4)+5
<br>but
<br>3-(4-5) &ne; (3-4)-5

<p><br>
  Very occasionally you'll define a two-input custom reporter for use with <code>combine</code>.

The two-input <code>max</code> block is an example; try using that to find the largest of a list of numbers.<b><br>
</b><br> -->
<br>First, you'll need to write a <code>sum of</code> reporter that takes a list as input and reports the sum of all of the items in the list.
<br>Then, use the <code>sum of</code> block to define an <code>average of</code> block that takes also list as input.

You can use the following input to test out the <code>average of</code> block:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/avg781.png" alt="average of the list 7,8,1 is 5.333333" title="average of the list 7,8,1 is 5.333333"/>
<!-- <br>Is that the answer you'd expect?<br><br> -->

<br>In addition to <code>sum of</code> and <code>average of</code>, go ahead and make reporters for other statitical functions:
<ul>
  <li><code>max of</code>: the largest value in the list</li>
  <li><code>min of</code>: the smallest value in the list</li>
  <li><code>median of</code>: the middle value of an odd number of items or the average of the two middle values for an even number of items. For now, check that the list is increasing first.</li>
  <li><code>mode of</code>: the most common value in the list. For now, check that the list is increasing first.</li>
</ul>
